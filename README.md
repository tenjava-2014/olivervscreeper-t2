What is this plugin?
---------------------
The idea of this plugin is that players can mine blocks, and collect energy
from the world by doing this. Different blocks yield different results,
for example, stone which yields 2 energy. Collated energy can then be used
by players to perform new, cool actions, listed below.

Configuration:
---------------
- In the 'Energy Values' section, the yield of each block type is defined.
You can add outcomes of any block by specify it's id, a ':', and then
the energy yield.

PowerUps:
--------------

When pigs fly - 200EG:
By punching a pig, you can activate flying for 10 seconds. After this period,
you will fall without warning, so be sure to land in a safe place where
you won't take fall damage!

The Awesome Archer - 5EG:
By left clicking with the energy tracker, you can shoot an arrow from your
position. You can't change the velocity, it's always the same, so get used
to it!

InstaKill - 80EG:
If you hit a mob with the energy tracker, and have enough energy, he will
take 500 blocks worth of fall damage- this will kill most mobs, but be
warned, you can't use it to kill any bosses!

BungeeCord - 25EG:
If you press shift while holding the energy tracker, you will be launched
to a great distance in the air! Be warned, while you won't take fall
damage, it's hard to control, could leave you stuck or even in lava!


Crafting:
----------
![Alt text](http://puu.sh/a8eYx/aa6d9848f5.png "Crafting Recipe")
The only item in the game is the energy tracker. It's shapeless, so just
add an apple and a stick into a crafting table. You can click with this
item to easily see your energy levels. Be warned though, it has a chance
of spawning a curse! Oh oh.
